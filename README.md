## Objectives

The aim is to build a deep learning model using LSTM which can predict the sentiment from text. It will classify whether the text has positive/negative sentiment. We will make use of tensorflow, keras library for builidng this deeplearning model.

### Problem Statement

1. Total number of positive and negative sentiments.
2. Sequential LSTM model to predict positive and negative sentiments.
3. Based on the model, check the sentiment for the following two sentences.
